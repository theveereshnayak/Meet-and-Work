2. Register and add your email to get an **Access Key**.
3. In the `form` tag, update the `access_key` value with the key you received:

   ```html
   <form action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit" method="POST">
     <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">
     <!-- Add your fields -->
   </form>
